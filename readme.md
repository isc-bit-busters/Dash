# Dashboard
We used Dash to create a dashboard that displays the logs from the robot, images from the camera, and the robot's position on a map. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and provides real-time updates on the robot's status.
# Installation
To install the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage

```bash
